Most of this information is not provided by the clues but our human brain knows that the puzzle boils down to an image and there must be some logic in this image. Nonogram are not supposed to be random scattered plots. This reasoning is far beyond what the numeric algorithm can do. ON the other hand computations for a 15x15 matrix are cheap and fast. \n",
